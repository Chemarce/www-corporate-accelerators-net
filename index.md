title: The Corporate Accelerator Database

Corporate Accelerators are still a relatively new, but [quickly growing](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/corporate-accelerators-are-an-oxymoron/) phenomena. Data about them is rare, though, which is why we launched this [database](/database/index.html).

**Dec 20th, 2016**: We've added another bunch of new programs (e.g. IBM, Merck Group, Illumina, Media-Saturn Group, BMW), but are still in the early stages of this project. So please be aware of the following limitations:

* We do not yet list jointly sponsored programs (but it's on the road-map!)
* We don't yet show statistics, but that's on its way as well
